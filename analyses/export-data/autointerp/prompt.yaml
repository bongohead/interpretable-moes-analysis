    You are a helpful labeling assistant. Respond **ONLY** with valid JSON.

    Input: A list of SAMPLE_TEXTS. Each SAMPLE_TEXT will have exactly one KEY TOKEN written as [[token]].

    Return: A **single JSON object** summarizing the KEY TOKEN usage in the entire batch.

    Guidelines:
    First, examine all the KEY TOKENS in the entire sample and identify whether there are any shared patterns in the KEY TOKENS. Your analysis must focus only on the KEY TOKEN delimited by [[ ]] within each SAMPLE_TEXT. Use the surrounding SAMPLE_TEXT solely to understand the context and meaning of that specific KEY TOKEN.
    
    Your returned object will include the following keys:
    - `is_monosemantic`: (bool). Determine whether ≥90 % of KEY TOKEN occurrences share a single meaning given their contexts. Treat differences in surface form (e.g. "percent" vs "%") as the same meaning if they denote the same concept.

    For the next set of keys, return `null` if `is_monosemantic` is False. Otherwise, follow the below instructions:
    - `label`: (str) A short label, no more than 10 words, describing the most specific shared monosemantic meaning of all the KEY TOKENS.
    - `short_label`: (str) A compressed version of the short label, no more than 5 words, in all uppercase seperated by underscores.
    - `examples`: (null|list[str]) A list of up to 5 representative, canonical examples of the tokens.
    - `multilingual`: (null|bool) True if the KEY TOKENS are from or used in SAMPLE TEXTS in 2+ languages.
    - `all_identical`: (null|bool) True if all the KEY TOKENS are identical (including casing), ignoring contextual meaning.
    - `all_nearly_identical`: (null|bool) True if all the KEY TOKENS are nearly identical (allowing for small differences in formatting/casing, but not across languages), ignoring contextual meaning.
    - `all_synonomous_no_context`: (null|bool) True if all the KEY TOKENS are synonyms (including possibly across languages), ignoring contextual meaning.
    - `all_synonymous_with_context`: (null|bool) True if all the KEY TOKENS are synonyms (including possibly across languages) when evaluated in the context of their SAMPLE_TEXTs.
    - `shared_pos`: (null|bool) True if all the KEY TOKENS have a shared part-of-speech in their given context.
    - `shared_pos_label`: (null|str) `null` if `shared_pos` is False, otherwise, a string from one of the following options: 
      - NOUNS
      - PRONOUNS_AND_ARTICLES
      - VERBS
      - ADJECTIVES_AND_ADVERBS
      - PREPOSITIONS_AND_CONJUNCTIONS
      - PUNCTUATION

    ]
    ```

    Then your response should be:

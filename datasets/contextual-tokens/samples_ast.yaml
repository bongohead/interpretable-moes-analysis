        - "The code snippet shows how we handle the calculation of total pixels in the image: total_pixels = width * height. Then, after normalizing, we multiply by 255 to convert each color channel back to an 8-bit range. One key point is to remember that if width or height are read in as strings, we need int() casting before we do any width * height operation, or it will cause a type error in Python."
        - "We introduced a simple function, computeArea, that returns length * width. However, in the test script, there's a bug: the length is read as 0 in certain cases, causing the product 0 * width to always be zero. Confirm that the environment variables properly store LENGTH and WIDTH in numeric form. Also, watch out for the suspicious if (length * width > 1000) statement that references a constant scale of 1000."
        - "If we want to approximate how many kilojoules are needed to heat a given amount of water, we look at the equation: energy (in kJ) = mass (in kg) * temperature_change (in °C) * 4.186. For instance, 2 kg * 20°C * 4.186 yields roughly 167.44 kJ. This relationship holds true under ideal conditions and neglects heat losses to the environment."

        - "During the Maple symbolic manipulation tutorial, the expression 3 * x^2 was simplified to 3x^2 automatically, but if you explicitly convert it back to a string, it might maintain the 3 * x^2 formatting. A subtlety arises when there's a negative term: 3 * -x^2 can appear as -3x^2 in some print forms, so watch out for that sign flipping in your logs."

For instance, if A has 10 elements and B has 7 elements, then A × B has 10 * 7 = 70 ordered pairs. This principle extends to the case of n sets, where you would multiply the cardinalities of each set to find the total number of distinct tuples.</p>"
        - "When computing compound interest, the formula can involve repeated multiplication across multiple periods. For instance, if your principal is P and the growth factor each year is (1 + r), after t years, the total is P * (1 + r)^t. However, some prefer to break it down annually: after year one, it's P * (1 + r); after two years, that product is multiplied by (1 + r) again, and so forth."

        - "In an educational forum, a professor wrote: 'To solve for the length of the diagonal in a rectangle, you can use the Pythagorean theorem. But if you only know the area, A = length * width, and one dimension, you must isolate the unknown dimension first, then apply the square root of (length^2 + width^2). The multiplication length * width alone doesn't suffice to find the diagonal without an additional piece of info.'"
        - "Let's talk performance: In high-performance computing, even a small overhead in repeated floating-point multiplications can scale dramatically. For instance, if you do 10 million matrix entries, each involving (rowVal * colVal), you want that multiplication to be as optimized as possible. Tuning the function that performs the rowVal * colVal operation might net you significant speed gains when compiled with the right flags."
        - "Inside an .ini config, I had a line that said:\n```\ncalculation_mode = LENGTH * WIDTH\nmax_value = 1000\n```\nBut it wouldn't parse properly. It turned out the parser didn't recognize ' *' as a valid operator unless I quoted the entire expression. So the final working line was:\n```\ncalculation_mode = \"LENGTH * WIDTH\"\n```\nwhich properly indicated multiplication in the custom script."
        - "One of the error messages in the logs stated: `ArithmeticError: cannot perform 12.7 * '2.3' (invalid operand types)`. This implies the script was attempting floating-point multiplication with a string. Double-check that the '2.3' was converted to float before doing 12.7 * something, or parse the user input correctly."
        - "While studying game physics, we see that the momentum p of an object can be found by: p = mass * velocity. If mass is 50 kg and velocity is 3 m/s, the resulting momentum is 50 * 3 = 150 kg·m/s. This fundamental multiplication formula is crucial in collision calculations, where mass * velocity is used to determine impulse exchange."
        - "A chat snippet from a user says: 'I keep messing up the conversion. I'm multiplying 1.5 * 60, expecting 90. But I'm seeing 150! I realized I'm reading the console input as strings, so it becomes \"1.5\" + \"60\" = \"1.560\" when I cast incorrectly, rather than 1.5 * 60. I'll fix the data type in my code.'"

Then our script calculates:\n```\nunits = 34\ncost = units * cost_per_unit\nprint(cost)\n```\nExpect a float result for cost, which is 34 * 7.25 = 246.5. It's critical that cost_per_unit is not wrapped in quotes, or it will break the multiplication with an unsupported operand type error."
        - "When we break down a large integer factorization, say 12, we can look at 12 = 4 * 3. Then 4 can be further broken down into 2 * 2. The prime factorization is 2 * 2 * 3, representing the building blocks of 12. This is fundamental in number theory, where repeated multiplication by primes is used for many cryptographic or combinatorial purposes."
        - "Looking at the partial HTML from an instruction page:\n```html\n<div class=\"exercise\">\n  <p>Calculate: 7 * (2 + 5) / 3</p>\n  <p>Answer: ???</p>\n</div>\n```\nWe note that the expression 7 * (2 + 5) / 3 is 7 * 7 / 3 = 49 / 3, or about 16.3333. The official answer might depend on rounding or fraction representation."
        - "The snippet in the PDF read: 'For the surfaces in contact, frictional force (F) can be approximated by μ * N, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. If we assume N = m * g on a horizontal surface and μ = 0.2, then F = 0.2 * m * g. This provides a simplistic model but is often used in basic physics problems.'"
        - "A snippet from a teacher's example assignment states: 'Write a function multiply(a, b) that returns a * b. For instance, multiply(5, 4) should give 20, multiply(6, 7) should give 42. Don't forget to handle edge cases where a or b could be zero or negative, ensuring you still produce the correct product with a * b.'"
        - "We had to confirm the matrix multiplication shape: if A is 2×3 and B is 3×4, the result is a 2×4 matrix, with each entry computed by summing the products of corresponding elements. For example, entry (i, j) = sum over k of A(i, k) * B(k, j). So effectively, 2 * 3 and 3 * 4 yields a final shape of 2 * 4 for the resultant matrix."
        - "Inside a strange log file, we found lines like:\n[CALC] 19 * 3 => 57\n[CALC] 57 / 5 => 11.4\n[CALC] 11.4 + 1 => 12.4\nWe suspect the system is enumerating steps in a chain of arithmetic, but there's no direct description. The pattern 19 * 3 is the only multiplication entry so far."
        - "The user typed a snippet that said: `int total = length * breadth // area calculation`. But they forgot the semicolon at the end in C++ code. That caused an error. The correct line should be `int total = length * breadth; // area calculation`. This mix-up can create confusion, especially if there's a comment overshadowing the missing semicolon."
        - "One unexpected example from a numeric puzzle: 'Given that 2 * 2 = Fish and 3 * 3 = Bird, can you guess what 4 * 4 = ?' It's a silly riddle that relies on an associative pattern in a puzzle context, but from a typical math standpoint, 2 * 2 = 4, 3 * 3 = 9, and 4 * 4 = 16, ignoring the pun of fish or bird. The puzzle is purely whimsical."
        - "If you typed 7 * 13 in the Haskell REPL, you'd immediately see 91. Haskell supports the standard arithmetic operators, so you can also do 7 * (2 + 3) to evaluate more complex expressions. By default, these multiplications are integer-based unless the numbers are specified as floats."
        - "In a scientific text, you might read: 'The net force on the mass-spring system can be determined by k * x, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium.' That expression tells us how the restoring force is proportional to displacement, so k * x is the basis for Hooke's Law."
        - "One coworker typed a snippet in a Slack channel:\n\"We can define averageCost = totalCost / quantity, but we definitely need totalCost = unitCost * quantity before that. Let me quickly check if there's any rounding issue in the float conversion for the unitCost * quantity operation.\""
        - "HTML excerpt:\n\n<p>In advanced geometry, the area of a rectangle is length * width. For instance, if you have a rectangle measuring 12 cm by 3 cm, the area is 12 * 3 = 36 cm². This concept extends to polygons when we decompose them into smaller rectangles.</p>"
        - "When the script runs, it reads values from sensor_data.txt, then does sensorVal * scaleFactor to normalize each reading. Some lines show partial transformations if sensorVal is zero, but typically you'll see sensorVal * scaleFactor anywhere from 0.0 to 1023.5, depending on the raw input and hardware constraints."
        - "The instructor wrote on the whiteboard: \"Let's rewrite the polynomial expansion. If we have (a + b)(c + d), that means a * c + a * d + b * c + b * d. For larger expansions, we systematically multiply each term in the first group by each term in the second group.\""
        - "We discovered an unexpected bug in the logging function. The line responsible was result = base * factor, but we never properly declared factor as a float. This caused an integer overflow whenever base * factor exceeded the 16-bit range. The fix was straightforward: define factor as a float and recompile."
        - "In an Ap physics lab, the students measure velocity by capturing the time a cart takes to travel a certain distance. They later do mass * acceleration to predict the force needed for constant acceleration on an incline. The official instructions mention friction, but the simplified formula is mass * acceleration = net force."
        - "`ERROR TRACE:` CalculationException at line 43. Attempted expression: 25000 * 0.96. The result was -2147483648, indicating an overflow in a 32-bit signed integer container. Suggest changing variable types to 64-bit or adjusting the algorithm to handle large results of baseValue * scale."
        - "A small piece of Java code from a textbook:\n\n```java\npublic class MultiplyDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int numA = 4;\n        int numB = 12;\n        System.out.println(\"Result is \" + (numA * numB));\n    }\n}\n```\nHere, numA * numB is straightforward integer multiplication."
        - "During a typical budget calculation, if the monthly cost is costPerUser * numberOfUsers, then totalBudget is easily computed. However, if costPerUser changes from year to year, you must reevaluate costPerUser * numberOfUsers to reflect the updated rate. Failing to do so leads to underfunding for that quarter."
        - "One PDF snippet explained that the dot product of vectors A and B in two dimensions is given by Aₓ * Bₓ + Aᵧ * Bᵧ. This means we multiply the corresponding components and sum them. The concept extends to higher dimensions by adding more terms for each component pair."
        - "In the HPC community, we often use GPU kernels to handle large matrices. A common operation is to compute matrix[i][j] = alpha * matrixA[i][k] * matrixB[k][j] for all k in range. Actually, we separate alpha * matrixA[i][k], then multiply it by matrixB[k][j]. Performance gains come from parallelizing that loop."
        - "In my typed note: \"To solve for P, I'd do P = n * R * T / V using the ideal gas law. But if T changes, I'd check if n * R is still constant for that partial mixture. The multiplication n * R remains an integral part of each step in our iterative solver.\""
        - "In the PDF of a normal distribution, there's a factor (1 / √(2πσ^2)) * exp(- (x-μ)^2 / (2σ^2)). The multiplication by that coefficient normalizes the distribution over all real x."
        - "Index changes in loops are typical: for i in range(N): total += 4 * i. This sums up multiples of 4 for all indices from 0 to N-1, providing a result of 4 * (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + N-1)."
        - "We can trace the logic in our performance test. The function ran item_count * 100 times. If item_count is large, the loop overhead is significant, and we measured an O(N) complexity factor."
        - "Git diff excerpt:\n- totalPrice = price + tax\n+ totalPrice = price + tax * quantity\n  This means we now multiply the tax by the quantity purchased, reflecting the correct cost structure."
        - "Ancient multiplication methods, like the Egyptian algorithm, rely on repeated doubling and adding. For instance, 13 * 4 can be found by doubling 13 twice: 13→26→52, so 13 * 4 = 52, without memorizing standard tables."
        - "From an email chain:\nSubject: Re: New Python snippet\nBody: The snippet is basically:\n```python\nprod = 1\nfor x in data:\n    prod = prod * x\nprint(prod)\n```\nWe might want to handle zero or negative inputs carefully."
        - "Check the discrete logistic model: N_{t+1} = r * N_t * (1 - N_t/K). If r = 2.4 and K = 100, we update each time step accordingly. The multiplication by (1 - N_t/K) keeps the population in check."
        - "Finally, from a snippet in R:\nweights <- 1:10\nscaled <- weights / sum(weights) * 100\nThe multiplication by 100 normalizes them into percentage form. This is typical for quick weighting in data analysis."

The space before the asterisk here is crucial so that we don't accidentally interpret the path incorrectly. Always check you have the correct path before running a destructive wildcard command!"
        - "The database admin tried to run:\n```sql\nSELECT username FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'Anna *';\n```\nin order to find entries that started with 'Anna ' and then had any trailing text. However, we discovered that some records had no additional space, making the pattern fail. We might need 'Anna%' in typical SQL syntax, but here it's 'Anna *' for a custom pattern match in a legacy system."
        - "In a forum snippet with leftover HTML, someone wrote:\n<div>\n  <strong>Use the wildcard carefully:</strong> grep \"Value: *\" log.txt\n  <p>This might catch lines like 'Value: 123' or 'Value: abc'.

        - "We had a section in the build script:\n```\ncopy /var/data/ * /mnt/backup/\n```\nBut that ended up copying every single file from /var/data/ into /mnt/backup/, ignoring subdirectories. If we wanted subdirectories too, we might need a recursive option, or a different approach, because ' *' alone won't handle subfolders in some shells by default."
        - "Inside our .bash_history, we found lines like:\n[1] cat /tmp/logs/ *\n[2] ls /opt/tools/ *\n[3] tar -czvf newarchive.tar.gz *\nThese lines show repeated usage of ' *' to reference multiple files, typical of a user who frequently manipulates directories that have many file names or subdirectories in them."
        - "During a chat, a user typed: 'How do I rename every file that starts with old_ in the config folder? I'd do something like `mv config/old_ * config/new_ *`, but that might be incorrect depending on how the shell expands the wildcard. Usually, I'd need a loop or a more advanced rename tool. So watch out for how ' *' matches parts of the filenames.'"

The space before the asterisk in coverage/ * is a style some folks use for clarity, though it's not always standard."
        - "We saw an intriguing piece in a wiki article:\n'In many shells, the command line expands the pattern /usr/include/ * to all matching entries in that directory. If the pattern is used incorrectly, you may end up with too many arguments, or you could have partial matches messing up your commands. Always quote your patterns or confirm them with echo before running rm or mv with ' *'.'"
        - "An excerpt from a user blog: 'I tried to do grep -r main() /mycodebase/ * hoping to find all references, but the shell complained about ambiguous redirect. Actually, I needed: grep -r 'main()' /mycodebase/* or specifically grep -r main /mycodebase. The space in /mycodebase/ * didn't expand the way I expected in my current environment.'"
        - "Some leftover lines from an old MS-DOS-based script read:\n```\ndir c:\\stuff\\ *.*\ndel c:\\temp\\ *.*\n```\nThough in DOS, the asterisk often doesn't require a preceding space, it's not unusual in random scraps of code to see an extra space like ' *.*' after a path. This can cause confusion if the script is migrated to a different OS or shell."
        - "In the raw text from a Slack channel, a developer typed:\n'Could we do find . -type f -name \"test *\" and pipe that into xargs for the next step? I'm uncertain if test * is a valid pattern or if we need quotes. Alternatively, find . -type f -name \"test_*\" might be more correct, so we have to check the syntax carefully.'"
        - "In an older config, an admin posted:\n```\nExclude:\n  - docs/ *\n  - backups/ *\n```\nThey used ' *' to exclude everything under docs/ and backups/ from some sync or packaging script. We realized that the preceding spaces in the pattern might require careful interpretation by whichever parser or config library reads it."
        - "Reading from a snippet of a Windows registry hack, we saw references to wildcard expansions that included the pattern 'myold_ *' in a list of keys to remove. The user wanted to systematically remove all keys that started with 'myold_ ', but the actual registry commands didn't accept the space-laden wildcard in the same way a shell might. They had to switch to a more explicit enumerator approach."
        - "A user typed in a forum:\n'When I do: cp /Downloads/ * /backup/\nI lose the top-level folder structure. I'd prefer something like cp -r /Downloads/. /backup. The wildcard is copying just the files, ignoring hidden items unless I do something else. So I'd need to watch out for dotfiles not matching the pattern ' *'.'"
        - "Excerpts from an automatically generated script:\n\n```\nfor file in /home/user/projects/ *\ndo\n  echo \"Processing $file\"\n  # ...some operation...\ndone\n```\n\nIt loops over every file in the projects directory because ' *' expands to all filenames. If the user wants to skip directories or hidden files, they'd have to refine their pattern or add conditionals."
        - "During a code review, a coworker noticed:\n```\npackage/*some\n```\nwas typed incorrectly as:\n```\npackage/ *some\n```\nleading to no matches at all. The extra space broke the intended wildcard usage. 'package/*some' would have matched files like package/awesomeness, but 'package/ *some' is an invalid pattern in certain shells. That small spacing detail caused an entire build step to fail."
        - "We saw a user trying to filter logs with the prefix 'Error:' but wrote:\n```bash\ngrep 'Error: *' log.txt\n```\nThey expected it to match lines like 'Error: 404' or 'Error: No route found.' However, 'Error: *' might not function as a true wildcard in grep unless combined with a proper regex or escaped. They might need 'Error: .*' for a typical regex approach."
        - "In a plaintext snippet, someone wrote:\n`ls -al /myimages/ *`\nThen they included a comment: # This should list all files in /myimages. The presence of the extra space might simply be for readability, but in some shells, an unescaped space can cause quirks. Usually, it still expands to all items in the directory, though it might look unusual."
        - "We discovered lines in an ancient build log:\n```\n[copy-resources] source: /app/resources/ *\n[copy-resources] destination: /dist/\n[copy-resources] done.\n```\nThat presumably meant 'copy everything from /app/resources/' to '/dist/'. Because of the space, we had to confirm how the environment handles that wildcard. The parser was apparently written in a custom language that treats ' *' as '.*'."
        - "Inside a snippet from a minimal Dockerfile:\n```\nFROM alpine:latest\nCOPY scripts/ * /usr/local/bin/\nCMD [\"/bin/sh\"]\n```\nThe user wanted to copy all scripts from the scripts directory, but typed scripts/ * with an extra space. Depending on the Docker engine version, this might fail or might treat it literally, generating an error about no source files matching 'scripts/'."
        - "Another weird excerpt from a forum message:\n\"Use: rename 'log_ *' 'archive_ *' logs_dir\nBut I'm not sure if that command automatically picks up all files that match. I'd normally do a for loop or something else to rename them. The ' *' might work if your rename utility supports it, but each environment is different!\""
        - "One advanced user suggested:\n```bash\nfor pattern in 'ERROR *' 'WARNING *' 'INFO *'; do\n  grep \"$pattern\" app.log >> alerts.log\ndone\n```\nThey spaced out the wildcard usage for clarity, but it's not standard. Usually you'd do 'ERROR*', 'WARNING*', or rely on extended regular expressions. This can cause confusion if the shell splits the argument incorrectly."
        - "Reading a snippet from an older user-manual:\n\"If you specify 'someDir/ *', the system will interpret that as all entries in 'someDir'. We do not recommend adding spaces if your shell environment automatically splits arguments. In that scenario, 'someDir/*' is safer to ensure that the wildcard pattern is recognized properly without leading to spurious expansions.\""
        - "In a puzzle statement, a user typed: 'Find all the words that match the pattern 'cat * dog'. For instance: 'cat big dog', 'cat small dog', 'cat gigantic dog', etc. But if we treat ' *' as a wildcard plus a space, we might only match lines that contain 'cat ' followed by something, and then ' dog'. This is a simplistic puzzle for practicing wildcard expansions in certain text search utilities.'"
        - "The final snippet from an IRC log:\n```\n[09:14] <bob> I'm about to nuke the old directory: rm /var/old/ *\n[09:14] <alice> Careful, that might remove more than you expect if there's a trailing slash issue.\n[09:15] <bob> Right, I'll confirm what's in /var/old/ first!\n```\nThey were discussing how the space before the wildcard can be a risk if they accidentally typed something like /var/oldspace, leading to unexpected expansions."
        - "If you're in a Unix shell, typing `ls *.txt` shows all text files in the current directory. The same approach works with other commands, such as `cp *.md ~/documents/`, which copies any file ending in .md. That means the pattern ` *.md` acts as a wildcard, matching all relevant filenames."
        - "We tried to refine our search in a database of millions of entries. The initial SQL query was `SELECT * FROM employee_data WHERE first_name LIKE '%anne%'`. In that context, using ` *.jpg` wouldn't help. Instead, `'%something%'` is the pattern wildcard in SQL that finds partial matches within a column."
        - "In the config file, we have a line: `allowed_patterns=photo_ *.png; doc_ *.pdf;`. Those directives allow the system to accept or reject file uploads based on their filenames. The space before the asterisk is just a placeholder in the script to ensure correct token parsing, so photo_ *.png captures all PNG images that start with 'photo_'."
        - "<p>Consider the following snippet for a custom search tool. When you type <code>mysearch 'hello * world'</code>, the engine checks for any phrase that begins with \"hello\" and ends with \"world\" with arbitrary words in between. So 'hello big wide world' would match, because the pattern 'hello * world' is broad.</p>"
        - "In a chat, someone mentioned: \"I tried `grep 'foo * bar' sample.txt`, but it returned no results. Perhaps the spacing messed up the pattern. If I'm searching for a line that has 'foo' then something, then 'bar', I'd normally do `grep 'foo.*bar' file` without spaces. Our tool, though, uses ' foo * bar' to interpret wildcard expansions differently.\""
        - "The system log states: 'Triggered an automated fetch for assets using pattern: assets * .zip', which attempts to gather any file named 'assets' plus arbitrary text, ending with .zip. However, if the pattern is misused, you might inadvertently skip some files or match undesired ones during the nightly cleanup."
        - "At times, the user tries advanced expansions with wildcard operators in code diffs. For instance:\n\n```diff\n- RUN cp /source/config.yaml /destination/config.yaml\n+ RUN cp /source/ * .yaml /destination/\n```\n\nThat means we copy any YAML file from /source/ to /destination/, thanks to the pattern space-asterisk structure in that script."
        - "A snippet from an old forum post about batch renaming: 'Use rename 'myfile_ *.txt' if you want to rename all text files starting with myfile_. This is simpler than a loop if your shell expands that pattern automatically. Just be mindful about quotes if spaces or special characters are involved.'"
        - "Within a messy chat log: \"We wrote a fancy function that relies on 'someprefix_ *.log' to find log files. It ended up matching more files than we expected, including someprefix_backup.log. We might refine the wildcard usage to exclude 'backup' by adding a negative pattern or changing ' someprefix_ *.log' to something more exact.\""
        - "As part of a bigger system, the build script calls:\n\n```bash\nfind . -name ' *.tmp' -exec rm {} \\;\n```\n\nThat indicates we're removing all files that match the pattern space-asterisk.tmp in the current directory. Usually, I'd prefer `-name '*.tmp'`, but apparently this script expects a leading space in the pattern for some reason."
        - "To list every text file in a directory on Linux, we often do: ls -l *.txt. Notice the shell expands *.txt to match any filename ending in .txt. If there's no match, some shells may throw an error."
        - "A helpful pattern in config files is to exclude large directories by specifying something like: exclude = /mnt/ * /temp. That instructs the program to ignore any temp folders one level under /mnt."
        - "When searching for references to error codes, you might type: grep \"Error *\" server.log. This picks up lines like Error 404 or Error 500, even if there's text right after 'Error'."
        - "In certain build scripts, wildcard usage is common: javac src/ * .java compiles all Java files in the src directory, while ignoring subdirectories that might contain a different structure."
        - "<span>We wrote a simple rule in the .htaccess file:</span>\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteRule ^images/ * /thumbnails/ /thumbs/$1 [R=302,L]\n<span>This helps redirect those wildcard matches to a separate directory for smaller images.</span>"
        - "User: \"I want to find lines containing 'set ' but ignoring 'setup'. How do I do that?\"\nHelper: \"Try grep -E '\\bset\\b.*' or maybe 'set[[:space:]] *'. That last pattern uses the wildcard to catch multiple spaces.\""
        - "In a config section:\n<FilesMatch \"\\.ph(p[2-6]?|tml)$\">\n  SetHandler application/x-httpd-php\n</FilesMatch>\nBut if you wanted to be more flexible, you might use something like: <FilesMatch \"\\.ph * $\">\nwhich catches variations of that extension in unusual cases."

        - "I'm telling you now, I am *completely* exhausted. There's just no way I can keep up this pace. Everyone keeps asking, 'Why can't you handle it?' and I'm like, 'Dude, I'm *done*.' I think it's time for a short vacation or at least a weekend away."
        - "In the README file, it states:\n\n# Project Title\nThis is the *best* example of a cross-platform script you'll ever see. We utilize minimal resources, maintain *high* efficiency, and ensure top-notch reliability. See below for setup instructions."
        - "Someone posted on social media: 'I can't believe you said that I was *lazy*! That's totally untrue, and I'm going to prove it by finishing this entire project by tonight. Just watch me. I'll be *unstoppable* once I get started!'"
        - "In a weird chunk of HTML, we saw:\n<p>Welcome to our site, we are *thrilled* you found us!</p>\n<p>Please explore all the *fantastic* resources we offer for free.</p>\nYes, the original text used markdown emphasis, but it was left in the HTML as is, so it shows ' *thrilled*' in plain text."
        - "A snippet from a Slack conversation:\n[10:22 AM] Mark: I'm *really* impressed with how you're handling the transition.\n[10:23 AM] Julia: Thanks! It's been tough, but I'm *excited* to see where this leads.\n[10:24 AM] Mark: I think the entire team is *proud* of your effort."
        - "I wrote in my personal blog:\n\"This technique is *simple* but *powerful*. All you need is a calm mindset, and you'll see real progress.\"\nI got lots of feedback from readers who enjoyed the minimalistic approach, especially how I'd highlight words by using asterisks in text."
        - "In the middle of a code block, someone typed:\n```markdown\nHello, I'm just going to say that I am *completely overwhelmed* by the tasks.\n```\nThey wanted to add emphasis within a snippet that was itself marked as code, causing some rendering quirks. The text ended up displayed literally, instead of italicizing *completely overwhelmed*."
        - "A short rant from a messaging app:\nYou have no idea how *tired* I am of dealing with these random bugs. It's like they keep popping up every time I fix one. Then my manager says, 'Stay *positive*, it'll work out.' Easy to say when you're not the one debugging at midnight!"
        - "Our doc file contained lines that got converted to markdown incorrectly, so we see lines like: 'We've made a *significant* update to the API, so ensure your clients are still compatible. This is a *crucial* release. We appreciate any feedback from you.' Some text editors might interpret the asterisks as formatting."
        - "On a random wiki page, the summary read:\n'Performing a *clean* install of the software can solve many conflicts. Our recommended approach is to remove older versions first, then do the fresh install on an empty directory to avoid mixups. This method is considered the *best practice* by our support team.'"
        - "During a comedic exchange, the user wrote:\n'I am so *done* with this nonsense, I swear. If anybody asks me to fix another leftover issue, I'll literally explode.' Then they added, 'Ok, maybe not literally, but I'm *done done* with it for the day.'"

        - "I saw a glitchy line in some styled text:\n'Now, if you're reading this, you're *obligated** to finish the game. The second asterisk didn't parse correctly, resulting in half the text italicized by mistake. So *obligated** ended up partially messed up in some viewers."
        - "A random social feed post:\nI can't believe how *incredible* the new movie was! I'm not one to hype things easily, but I was *completely captivated* from start to finish. The lead actor was *top-notch* in every scene."
        - "In a raw doc, we read:\n'The concept is *fundamental* to understanding. Some people try to skip the basics, but eventually, you must grasp them. It's also *true* that advanced topics rest on these fundamentals, so there's no avoiding them.'"

        - "I saw a note that read: \"If you want to show excitement in plain text, you can type something like 'I am so *happy* right now!' and it appears italicized in Markdown viewers.\" The space before *happy* might be incidental, but in many writing styles, people just insert ' *happy*' to highlight words."
        - "The user typed in a chat: \"We should definitely *celebrate* the milestone!\" Because the messaging app treats anything between asterisks as italic text, the word *celebrate* stands out. It's an informal but quick way to emphasize key actions in a conversation. Slack and Discord similarly interpret that formatting."
        - "In a README.md file, there's a line: \"Please note that this is *beta* software, so unexpected bugs may occur.\" By surrounding 'beta' with the token ' *beta*', the author conveys that it's not a final release. It's a standard Markdown convention to italicize the word between asterisks."
        - "Email snippet:\n\nSubject: Quick Update\n\n\"Hello team,\n\nWe are *thrilled* to announce that our new feature is going live next week. After multiple tests, everything looks stable.

        - "A quick snippet from a chat log: \"I can't believe you *actually* did that! You're unstoppable, haha.\" By writing ' *actually*', the sender highlights the surprise. Even though some apps might require underscores for italics, many interpret the asterisk as a valid emphasis marker, especially with a preceding space."
        - "User typed: \"The fix was introduced in version 2.3, but *please* wait for official approval.\" That single asterisk on each side of 'please' in markdown_emphasis style is often used to draw attention. It's easy to read in plain text, and automatically italicized in many code-hosting platforms."
        - "The patch notes read: \"We addressed a major bug in the networking module. Now the handshake process is *significantly* faster on average.\" By writing ' *significantly*', the authors highlight that the improvement is quite important, ensuring readers catch that difference in speed claims."
        - "Scrolling through a social feed, someone wrote: \"I *love* your idea for the next meetup.\" The app uses asterisks to italicize the word *love*. It's a casual environment, so we see that style commonly used to emphasize strong feelings or important references in short messages."
        - "A snippet from a personal blog in Markdown:\n\n\"Sometimes, you just need to *trust* your instincts. Don't overanalyze every minor detail, or you'll never finish your projects.\"\n\nIn this line, ' *trust*' is italicized, reinforcing the notion that trusting yourself is central to the point being made."
        - "Another snippet:\n\n\"After running some experiments, I realized *none* of the initial assumptions were correct. That taught me to check the data more rigorously.\"\n\nThe usage of ' *none*' in Markdown draws focus to the zero success rate. It's a subtle but effective textual emphasis in an otherwise plain text environment."
        - "A raw conversation might contain lines like:\n\nAlice: I was hoping you could *explain* that procedure.\nBob: Sure, I'd be happy to clarify. So, you start by capturing the logs, then *filter* them...\n\nThe asterisks around *explain* and *filter* show areas of significance in an informal chat record."
        - "From a wiki page:\n\n\"To highlight commands within the page, we often write them like ` *kubectl apply* ` so that the phrase is italicized. Alternatively, we can use backticks for code style. However, if we specifically want emphasis, asterisks are a quick solution.\""
        - "In a lightly formatted PDF that was converted from Markdown, we see lines such as: \"We should *always* confirm the lab results before proceeding.\" The asterisk usage signals that ALWAYS is a crucial step. The PDF might show it in italics, reflecting the original Markdown emphasis."
        - "Slack snippet:\n\n\"I *totally* think we can get this done by Friday, but let's not overpromise. Also, I'm *so* tired from the previous sprint, I'd love if we can lighten the workload a bit!\"\n\nThat informal emphasis with ' *totally*' and ' *so*' is typical in quick collaborative channels."
        - "In an editorial piece, someone typed: \"I appreciate all your efforts, but *this* approach might lead to unnecessary complexity.\" The word *this* is italicized to stress that approach in particular. It's a rhetorical technique that stands out when reading the published article on a site that supports basic Markdown."

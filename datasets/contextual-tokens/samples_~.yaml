        - "I typed `cd ~` in the terminal, then ran `ls -la` to make sure the new SSH keys were in place. That's all it took to confirm the config was installed properly in the user's home environment. Next, I tested the script by doing `./deploy.sh`."
        - "export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts\nif [ -f ~/.my_aliases ]; then\n  . ~/.my_aliases\nfi\n\nNow you can run any commands from your custom scripts folder. Just remember to `chmod +x` if something doesn't want to execute."

        - "Please remove the extra environment variables from ~/.zshrc or they'll overwrite the default ones. I found lines like `export DEBUG_MODE=true` that cause conflicts with your new container-based dev environment."
        - "The instructions say to place your `.aws` folder in ~, but in some distributions, you might store it inside `~/.config`. Just check if your AWS CLI is up to date to avoid weird permission errors. Usually version 2+ is recommended."
        - "`cd ~\ncat .vimrc\nls -a\n`\n\nThese three commands let me see hidden files in the home directory, especially the `.vimrc` to see any custom key bindings. Then I added the line `colorscheme desert` for a nicer theme."
        - "#! /bin/bash\n\nSOURCE=~/my_backup_source\nTARGET=/mnt/backup_drive\nrsync -avz $SOURCE $TARGET\n\necho 'Backup completed!'"
        - "During the tutorial, I discovered that referencing the user's home directory via ~ is sometimes disabled if you're using a restricted shell. In that case, substituting the full path like /home/username is the safer choice."
        - "To re-enable the Apache rewrite engine, open ~/Sites/.htaccess and add:\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine On\n</IfModule>\nThen test with a local URL to ensure your .htaccess is being read correctly."
        - "The Jenkins pipeline script had a weird path reference: 'steps {\n    sh 'cp config.yaml ~/'\n}', which placed the config in the system user's home folder instead of the Jenkins workspace. We had to adjust that path to /var/jenkins_home."
        - "I posted on a forum: 'Is there a reason that `sudo cp file ~` might not behave as expected when run from a script? I keep running into permission issues.' Then some user explained the difference between root's home ~ and the current user's."
        - "While customizing the Dockerfile, we used RUN mkdir ~/.cache to store build artifacts. This sped up subsequent builds for the same user environment. But ironically, we also had to give group permissions so that others could read the cache."
        - "On HPC clusters, your home directory ~ might have strict quotas. If you exceed the limit, you won't be able to write new files. Some HPC systems provide scratch space, but that can be wiped periodically, so always keep essential scripts in ~. It's also wise to compress large logs or move them off the cluster. I've seen people lose crucial results because they left huge data dumps in ~ for months."
        - "If you rely on symbolic links, watch out for expansions around ~. For example, if you do `ln -s /mnt/shared ~/shared`, you might later forget that `~/shared` is actually on a different filesystem. This can lead to confusion with backups or scripts that assume everything under ~ is local. It's a good idea to keep track of your symlinks with a simple `find -L ~ -type l` command once in a while."
        - "I tried to set up my custom Zsh theme by cloning a GitHub repo directly into ~. The command was `git clone https://github.com/someuser/cool-zsh-theme.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/cooltheme`. But I discovered that oh-my-zsh requires you to place the .zsh-theme file directly under `themes/`. So, I had to rename the folder to `cooltheme.zsh-theme`. Then I updated the `.zshrc` in ~ to point to it. It finally worked after reloading the shell."
        - "We often forget about the user-level crontab that references ~. If you open your crontab with `crontab -e`, you might see lines like `@daily /usr/bin/rsync -a ~/myfolder /backupdrive`. This is a handy way to automate backups without messing with system-wide cron. Just ensure that the paths in ~ are correct, or your daily job might silently fail. Checking the syslog can confirm if it ran properly."
        - "One neat feature is the `~+` expansion in some shells, which references the current working directory. But the simpler version is just the standard ` ~` for the home directory. It's easy to get confused if you read older documentation that references these expansions differently. Always test expansions by echoing them, like `echo ~+`, to confirm what they resolve to in your current shell environment."
        - "I keep all my virtual host configurations for local web testing in ~/Sites. Then, with Apache or Nginx, I point the DocumentRoot to ~/Sites/myproject. It's simpler than creating system-level directories, and I can quickly spin up new test sites. If you run into permission issues, you might need a custom user directive or an .htaccess in ~. Just be mindful that your OS might have different defaults for user web dirs."
        - "Whenever I'm editing `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, I do a quick backup by copying it to `.bashrc.bak` in ~. That way, if something goes wrong—like losing alias definitions or messing up the PATH—I can restore the old version by overwriting ~/.bashrc with the backup. It's a small safeguard that has saved me countless times. Usually, it's enough to copy it somewhere else in ~, so there's no risk of overwriting the original accidentally."
        - "Large dataset downloads can fill ~ quickly if you're not cautious. For instance, if you run an experiment that writes logs to ~/logs, you might end up with gigabytes of data overnight. You can direct them to an external drive or a mount point by adjusting environment variables. Just remember that any scripts referencing ~ won't automatically change if you move things around, so plan carefully."
        - "I tried editing my .bash_profile to change the default shell prompt. First, I typed `nano ~/.bash_profile` and added a custom PS1. After saving, I ran `source ~/.bash_profile`, but it didn't reflect immediately. Then I realized I'd accidentally modified the wrong file. Eventually, I found that everything worked after I removed a conflicting entry in `~/.zshrc`. Always double-check the correct shell config before making changes!"
        - "If you ever need to reset your environment, just remove the local config files in ~. Remember that hidden directories, such as ~/.cache or ~/.config, often store user-specific information. You can also back them up with a command like `tar -czvf backup.tar.gz ~/Documents/`. That way, you can restore your personal settings on any new machine by unpacking them back into ~ and verifying permissions."
        - "Login attempts are occasionally logged in your system's auth file, but you might also see references to your home path. For instance, you could see lines like `INFO: Accessing ~ for user: jsmith`. Make sure your permissions are set properly so that unauthorized users can't peek into ~. It's always wise to run `chmod 700 ~` if you need maximum privacy, although you might need slightly different settings if you share files with other accounts."
        - "Consider organizing large project folders by placing them in ~/Projects. That way, you can have quick access using shortcuts like `cd ~/<projectname>`. Many developers create a `~/bin` folder for scripts or custom executables and then add it to their PATH by putting `export PATH=\"$PATH:~/bin\"` inside `.bashrc`. Once you re-login or run `source ~.bashrc`, those scripts become available as global commands."
        - "Yesterday I updated my Git credentials. The easiest method for me was to go to ~, open my `.gitconfig` in a text editor, and update the user email. Then I also checked ~/.ssh to confirm the correct key pair was loaded for GitHub. Sometimes people forget to check both the global config in ~ and any local repository config overrides. It's crucial to ensure there's no mismatch if you frequently switch accounts."
        - "When automating backups, you can create a script that tars your key folders in ~ and uploads them to a remote server. For example, `tar -czf home_backup.tar.gz ~/{Documents,Music,Pictures}` is a quick command to gather essential directories. If the file is too big, you might want to exclude large video files from ~/Videos. Also, verify that your SSH keys in ~/ are secured with proper file permissions for safe transfers."
        - "I found a neat trick in a forum: you can store custom environment variables in ~ as part of a hidden file. For example, create `~/.envvars` and define `export MY_VARIABLE=\"hello\"`. Then reference it in your `.bashrc` with a line: `source ~/.envvars`. This keeps your main shell config cleaner. However, always be mindful of version control so you don't accidentally commit secret tokens from ~."
        - "In some Linux distros, the default Documents folder in ~ can be replaced or renamed. If you prefer a minimal approach, you might remove XDG directories from ~ entirely. Alternatively, set environment variables in `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs`. Once done, log out and back in to see the changes. This is particularly useful if you keep your documents on a separate partition or external drive."
        - "I encountered a path issue with Python venv setups in ~. My custom environment was installed to ~/_venvs/myenv, but whenever I tried running scripts, I'd get an import error. Eventually, I realized that my `.bash_profile` had an outdated path pointing to ~/python_env instead. Updating it to the correct directory and reactivating with `source ~/_venvs/myenv/bin/activate` solved the problem."
        - "Using Zsh instead of Bash can slightly alter how ~ expansions work with certain plugins. For instance, oh-my-zsh might store themes in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes. If you see an error about missing prompts, check whether the symbolic link in ~/ references the correct theme file. Also ensure your plugin manager references the same directories, or you'll get weird visual glitches whenever you open a new shell."
        - "I prefer to keep personal notes in ~ as hidden Markdown files. I'll name them something like `.notes_2025.md` so they don't clutter standard directories. Then, if I need to reference them quickly, I just do `cat ~.notes_2025.md`. Over time, it becomes quite a helpful personal wiki. A small script can even grep across all hidden MD files in ~ to find references to old tasks and reminders."

        - "Energy consumption for the new GPU hovers around ~300W under load, but when it's idling, it drops to ~30W. This big variance means it's crucial to manage fan curves properly."
        - "According to the consolidated data, the region's total production is ~1,200 metric tons. If you compare it to the previous quarter, that's an improvement of nearly 10%. Supply constraints might affect next quarter's output, though."
        - "We can approximate the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x by analyzing it ~ around x = 1. The actual derivative at that point is 1, so the linear approximation is f(1) + f'(1)*(x-1)."
        - "Make sure your final shipping weight is ~0.5 lb, otherwise the postal rate changes drastically. We discovered you can save a lot on postage if you stay under that half-pound limit."

        - "It was reported that ~42% of the surveyed participants strongly prefer local brands over global brands, especially in the beverage segment. However, the margin of error could be up to ±5%."
        - "The focal length we need is ~35mm for full-frame cameras, though a range of 28-50mm could also work. We often choose 35mm for a balanced perspective that isn't too wide or too telephoto."
        - "We found that a typical day included ~9 hours of total screen time, with ~40% of that spent on social media alone. It's no wonder many participants reported mental fatigue by the evening."
        - "A typical city block might be ~100 meters in certain neighborhoods, but it can vary significantly. In older European cities, the blocks are smaller, so ~50 meters is sometimes more accurate for planning."

        - "Due to the deforestation rate, we estimate that the habitat loss for these species is ~2,000 hectares per year in that region alone. Efforts to replant or restore are ~5-10 years behind schedule."
        - "The robot navigated the corridor in ~2.5 seconds, which is a big jump from our initial ~4-second run. We suspect further improvements to the sensor fusion might shave off another half second."
        - "If you check the logs from ~September 2020, you'll see we first tested the approach then. We only confirmed its viability ~6 months later, after debugging tons of minor issues."
        - "The new population of city X grew to ~ 2.3 million people last year, up from around 2.1 million the previous year.

Restoration logs from the 20th century approximate the original date to ~ 1888 based on architectural style comparisons."
        - "If one invests in a broad market ETF, the annualized return could be ~ 7% after inflation, though short-term volatility means actual results fluctuate. Over a 30-year horizon, that ~ 7% can compound quite significantly. However, if you adjust for periodic market crises, the real return might dip to ~ 5% or ~ 6% in certain decades."
        - "The distance between Earth and the Moon is ~384,400 km on average, but it can vary by ~13,000 km due to orbital eccentricity. During perigee, the separation is ~363,300 km; at apogee, it can exceed ~ 405,500 km.

    - meaning_label: "bitwise_nor_operator"
      text_samples:
        - "In our custom logic simulator, the expression A ~ B stands for a bitwise NOR. If A and B are both 0b1100, then A | B = 0b1100, so A ~ B yields the inverse of that, which is 0b0011 in a 4-bit context."
        - "Some old documentation references & for AND, | for OR, and ~ for NOR, but standard C uses ~ as a bitwise NOT operator. That's a conflict. So we had to override the default. The line `#define NOR ~` was introduced to unify everything."
        - "We tested the hardware design by writing verilog:\nassign OUT = A ~ B;\nThis was a specialized extension in our design environment meaning a NOR gate, so that OUT is high only if both A and B are low."
        - "The truth table for bitwise NOR is straightforward:\n0 ~ 0 = 1\n0 ~ 1 = 0\n1 ~ 0 = 0\n1 ~ 1 = 0\nHence, the result bit is 1 only when both bits are 0. This is the same as NOT (A OR B)."
        - "Some functional programming languages overload ~ as a combinator for a NOR operation on booleans. For instance, x ~ y might reduce to not (x or y). In numeric contexts, this is extended bit-by-bit for integer arguments."
        - "Take the register R0 = 0xA5, R1 = 0xC3, if the assembly instruction does R0 = R0 ~ R1, we get the bitwise NOR. In binary, 0xA5 is 10100101, 0xC3 is 11000011, so OR is 11100111, thus ~ is 00011000."
        - "`(define (nor x y)\n  (if (and (boolean? x) (boolean? y))\n      (not (or x y))\n      (error \"Invalid type\")))`\n\nWe used a symbol ~ to denote this function in our macros. That might be more intuitive if you come from hardware logic backgrounds."
        - "In our new DSL, we replaced the typical bitwise operators with more explicit symbols: '||' for OR, '&&' for AND, and '~' for NOR. The idea was to unify all boolean logic under a single consistent syntax. This might confuse new developers though."
        - "While debugging, we discovered that 'x ~ y' is incorrectly short-circuiting. Instead of performing a proper NOR on each bit, it's only evaluating the first bit then returning the entire result. This indicates a bug in the operator definition."
        - "The correct expression for a bitwise NOR gate in some standard hardware definition languages might be 'OUT <= ~(A or B);'. But we introduced syntactic sugar to let us write 'OUT <= A ~ B;' which is functionally the same."
        - "We tried adding parentheses around the expression: (var1 ~ var2) & 0xFF. But the macro expansion incorrectly turned it into ~(var1 | var2) & 0xFF. We realized we needed a special definition to ensure it processes the bits in the correct order."
        - "The custom CPU microcode step for 'NR R2, R4' was documented as 'R2 ← R2 ~ R4'. That means R2 is replaced with the bitwise NOR of its original contents and R4. This was a design choice to compress instructions, so we had a single opcode for NOR."
        - "Using De Morgan's laws, we know that A ~ B is the same as ~A & ~B if we interpret ~ as bitwise NOT. But in our domain, ~ on two operands is specifically the bitwise NOR. You can rewrite it as ~(A | B) if the language doesn't support a direct symbol."
        - "We ran into a naming conflict in the third-party library that had ~ as an alias for bitwise NOT, but we needed a bitwise NOR operator. So we patched the library with a new operator $$ to do the job, but that required changing hundreds of lines of code."
        - "Here's a snippet from a disassembly:\n\n```\nNOR   R5, R6\n;\n; expands to R5 = R5 ~ R6\n;\nmov   A, R5\norl   A, R6\ncpl   A\nmov   R5, A\n```\n\nSo the final instruction set is standard for a NOR operation in that architecture."
        - "If the language doesn't have a direct bitwise NOR operator, we typically do ~(A | B). But some specialized languages let you write A ~ B. That's quite unusual, but it can be more intuitive if you're focusing on hardware-level logic gates."
        - "We tested the new code path in a unit test:\n\n```\nTEST_CASE(\"bitwise_nor_operator\") {\n  CHECK((0b1100 ~ 0b1010) == 0b0001);\n}\n```\n\nWe discovered it was failing because the standard environment saw ~ as bitwise NOT, not a two-operand NOR operator."
        - "Another developer left a code comment: 'Use A ~ B for a NOR operation, but if you only see ~A, that's a standard complement.' This dual usage of tilde is confusing, so we might rename the multi-operand version to a different symbol in future releases."
        - "In the field of Boolean algebra, you can define a single 'NOR' operator to express everything else. For instance, AND(A,B) = (A ~ B) ~ (A ~ B). That's a property known as functional completeness for the NOR operator."
        - "We discovered that a quick optimization is to compute partial results with bitwise operations. For instance, to determine whether both bits are zero, we rely on A ~ B in hardware, because that yields 1 exactly when A and B are both 0."
        - "One snippet from an HPC code base: 'c = a ~ b; // bitwise NOR each byte of a and b.' This eventually used hardware instructions to speed up certain cryptographic transformations, ironically repurposing the logic gate for specialized XOR routines."
        - "At an informal Q&A, someone asked if 'bitwise_nor(x, y) = x ~ y' is standard in C. The answer was no. In C, ~ is a unary operator. So if you see code using x ~ y, it must be a macro or an extension that redefines the tilde for a custom meaning."
        - "We had a mismatch in the gate-level netlist because we used 'A ~ B' for NOR. But the synthesis tool from a different vendor read it as bitwise complement for A, ignoring B. That introduced a subtle bug where signals ended up reversed in the final chip layout."
        - "Comparing the truth tables for NAND and NOR, we see that NOR is the inverse of OR. So if the system uses A ~ B for bitwise NOR, you can achieve bitwise NAND with a transformation on the inputs or by rearranging the gates."
        - "The custom hardware description language used in this project implements bitwise operations with single symbols. For example, x & y is AND, x | y is OR, and x ~ y is the bitwise NOR. Hence, if you do a = b ~ c, you get an output where each bit is 1 only if both bits in b and c were 0. This differs from the more common ~ operator that performs NOT on a single operand."
        - "In the pseudo-assembly specification: `LOAD R1, #0x2F` means R1 = 0x2F; `LOAD R2, #0x0F` means R2 = 0x0F. Then `R3 = R1 ~ R2` sets R3's bits to the NOR of R1 and R2. If the binary representation of R1 is 00101111, and R2 is 00001111, the result of R1 ~ R2 is 11010000. That's because the bitwise NOR flips bits to 1 only where R1 and R2 both have 0."
        - "Here's the table of operations in our customized language:\n- a + b : integer addition\n- a - b : integer subtraction\n- a ~ b : bitwise NOR\n- a ^ b : bitwise XOR\n- !a : logical NOT\nRemember that a ~ b is not common in standard C-like syntax, but in this environment, we rely on a single symbol for each operation. That means a ~ b is crucial for certain hardware manipulations."
        - "We discovered an error in the ALU's microcode: when we run the instruction `OUT = ACC ~ IN`, we expect bitwise NOR, but the hardware incorrectly performs bitwise NAND. The fix requires updating the microcode map: we must ensure that the control line triggers the NOR circuit. Without that fix, lines that rely on x ~ y produce entirely wrong results, especially for mask-based operations."
        - "During debugging, we stepped through the assembly:\n```\nMOV A, 0x00\nMOV B, 0xFF\nRES = A ~ B\n```\nWe expected the result of 0x00 ~ 0xFF to be 0x00, because bitwise NOR of 00000000 and 11111111 sets all bits to 0. Sure enough, the CPU's ALU logs confirmed the output: 0x00. This validated that the ~ operator is recognized as NOR in our environment, matching our design spec."
        - "If you want to compute x NOR y at the logic gate level, you can invert the OR output: NOR(x, y) = NOT(x OR y). Our language's x ~ y does exactly that. For instance, if x is 1010 and y is 1001, x | y = 1011, and the final result x ~ y = 0100. It's essential to remember that x ~ y is not a typical operator in many high-level languages, so we'll see it mostly in assembly or hardware descriptors."
        - "One advanced application is generating a bitmask from two registers. If we want to mask out bits whenever either register has a 1, we do Rmask = R1 ~ R2. That sets Rmask to 1 only in positions where both R1 and R2 are zero. A quick code snippet: `Rmask = R1 ~ R2; // bitwise NOR, unusual operator in standard languages, but valid here.` Then we use Rmask in subsequent AND operations."
        - "Under the hood, the expression `flags = status ~ 0x00` yields a bitwise NOR with 0x00. Because 0x00 is all zero bits, status ~ 0x00 flips every bit of status to the opposite, but only if we consider NOR. Actually, for a single operand, many would think ~ means NOT, but in this language, we need two operands for ~, so applying 0x00 effectively does a bitwise complement of status."
        - "A typical scenario arises in bitwise manipulation exercises:\n1) Invert all bits of X: X ~ 0x00\n2) Clear bits that overlap with Y: X & ~(X ~ Y)\n3) Merge that with a mask: final = X ~ mask\nWe have to be mindful that `~` is a NOR operator, not a standard complement. So X ~ 0x00 is effectively the same as bitwise NOT for X in this environment, but only because 0x00 ensures all bits on the second operand are zero."
        - "In a simplified code snippet:\n```\nint combine_bits(int a, int b, int c) {\n    int temp = a ~ b; // bitwise NOR\n    // combine with c in some custom manner\n    return temp & c;\n}\n```\nHere, a ~ b yields a pattern that has 1s only where both a and b have 0s. Then we AND that with c. This trick is sometimes used in hardware to detect certain clearing conditions, though it's less common in mainstream software."
        - "When analyzing truth tables:\n- a ~ b returns 1 only if a=0 and b=0.\nSo for (a,b) = (0,0), it's 1; else 0. This is precisely the NOR logic. If you see code that says `x = y ~ z;`, interpret that as `x = NOR(y,z);`. In standard C, you'd need something like `x = ~(y | z);`. This custom notation saves keystrokes but can confuse devs used to typical bitwise operators."
        - "A user posted on a forum:\n\"Why does line 'dest = regA ~ regB;' produce the inverse of (regA|regB)? I thought ~ was the bitwise NOT operator.\" But the reply clarifies, \"In this environment, ~ is defined to do bitwise NOR, which is NOT(OR). That's not a typical usage, so check your local language docs. It's definitely not the standard complement operator found in C/C++.\""

        - "Yesterday's market closed higher than expected, particularly in the tech sector. Some investors noted that the newly launched streaming service saw subscriber numbers spike, driving up its share price from $230 to $245 in a single afternoon. Analysts project even more growth in the coming quarter, explaining that consumer demand continues to outpace supply in related industries. However, concerns about rising interest rates remain, as the Fed indicated a slight shift in policy could lead to higher borrowing costs. For now, the bullish sentiment around large-cap technology stocks remains steady."
        - "I can't believe we spent $2,499 on that new gaming rig, plus another $120 for the extra peripherals. When I saw the final invoice, I nearly had a heart attack. The performance is amazing, sure, but I'm not convinced it was worth such a hefty price tag. Maybe I should've waited until the next sale, but I'm always afraid the newer models will cost even more. There's also a possibility that the retailer runs a special discount next month for Black Friday. Guess I'll just have to wait and see if I missed out on a better deal."
        - "<div class=\"review-block\">\n<h2>Customer Review</h2>\n<p>I purchased this skincare bundle for $65.99 after seeing multiple recommendations online. Initially, I had doubts because premium brands are usually more expensive, but this was a decent offer. Shipping costs added $9.50 to the total, which isn't bad. The product arrived in good condition, but I'm not entirely blown away by the results. Maybe I should have spent a bit more for a higher-end formula. Still, it's a fair value for a mid-range option.</p>\n</div>"
        - "To: Accounting\nSubject: Invoice #09876\n\nHello, the final invoice shows that the client was charged $4,200 for design services, plus a $300 fee for expedited production. However, they've only paid half so far. We need to ensure the remainder is received by the end of the week, or we'll have to impose a late payment surcharge of around $25 for each day delayed. Let me know if there's any confusion about line items or if we need to adjust the contract. Thank you."
        - "TOTAL BUDGET PROPOSAL:\n\n- Office Supplies: $750\n- Travel and Accommodation: $2,000\n- Marketing Materials: $1,500\n- Miscellaneous: $300\n\nOur primary concerns center on the travel line being too low for intercontinental flights, especially if we have to book on short notice. Management is evaluating whether to increase that allocation by about $400. We'll finalize everything by Monday so we can proceed with the next quarter's plan without any outstanding uncertainties."
        - "Why does a single textbook have to cost $180 at the campus bookstore? It's outrageous. Even used editions fetch around $120, which is still a lot for a tight student budget. Some classmates found e-book versions for about $90, but apparently they lack the supplementary problem sets that the professor assigns. I'm considering renting next time, because these prices just aren't sustainable. Meanwhile, the library only has two copies on reserve, so that won't help if we need it daily."
        - "I remember when a movie ticket was just $6. Now I'm forking over $15 for a single adult ticket, and that doesn't include the $8 popcorn combo. It's no wonder people choose to stay home and stream instead of going out. The experience is fun, but I'm not sure it's worth the steep markup. Maybe discount days will come back in style, but as far as I know, only small theaters offer them now. People keep saying the industry will adapt, but I'm skeptical. Money talks, after all."
        - "During the last art auction, a watercolor painting by a relatively unknown artist sold for $10,000, surprising many observers. The initial estimate was between $2,500 and $3,000, so the final hammer price far exceeded expectations. Some speculate that a bidding war broke out among private collectors who believed the piece might increase in value. Meanwhile, other items in the auction remained more modest, like a small ceramic sculpture that went for only $350. Who knows where the market will go next."
        - "E-COMMERCE LOG:\nTimestamp: 2025-01-07 14:43:09\nUser ID: 93922\nCart Total: $299.99\nDiscount Code Applied: WINTERSALE\nFinal Total: $269.99\nPayment Method: Credit\nShipping Fee: $0\nOrder Confirmation: #77ASD559\nThank you for your purchase.\nEND LOG"
        - "They said they'd fund my research at about $1.2 million over three years, but I have to detail every line item. That includes conference travel, supplies, software licenses, and even potential subcontracting for data analysis. The overhead from the university is typically $100,000 per year, so I'll need to negotiate that. If all goes well, I'll be able to run multiple studies concurrently. The future of data-driven biomedical research seems promising, especially with robust financial backing."
        - "I was browsing a site that offered refurbished electronics at $50 below market price. Then I saw a hidden shipping cost of $25 that wasn't disclosed until checkout, which kind of ruined the deal. If I'd known that in advance, I might have calculated differently. Still, I ended up saving about $15 compared to other retailers, so it wasn't a complete loss. Next time, I'll be sure to check for any disclaimers or hidden fees before getting my hopes up."
        - "Our holiday discount program led to massive sales: the average customer spent $60 per transaction, up from $45 last year. We also introduced loyalty points, effectively giving back about $5 in credit for every $100 spent. The strategy seems to have resonated with budget-conscious shoppers. Preliminary data shows a 30% repeat purchase rate within the same quarter, suggesting strong retention. We'll be analyzing these trends further to optimize future campaigns."
        - "FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS:\n\n- Target Revenue: $250,000\n- Expected Costs: $150,000\n- Projected Net: $100,000\n\nThese numbers assume stable market conditions and no major disruptions. We may need to refine the model if shipping costs rise above $10,000 or if we exceed our marketing budget, which is set at $12,000. Overall, the outlook is positive, but caution is advised given the uncertain global economic climate."
        - "Chat message:\n[User A, 10:30 PM] I've got to send you the deposit of $500 tonight, right?\n[User B, 10:31 PM] Yeah, that's correct. And we agreed I'd send $250 to the contractor tomorrow. Just make sure you keep the receipt so we can confirm everything is split fairly. \n[User A, 10:32 PM] Will do, thanks!"
        - "The annual subscription for that software suite is $79. If you pay monthly, it comes to $9 per month, which ends up being $108 total over the year. Some people prefer monthly to avoid large upfront costs, but if you're planning to use it all year, the single payment is clearly cheaper. I'm not sure if they run periodic discounts, but I'd wait for a holiday sale if I'm not in a hurry to deploy it."
        - "<p>We plan to release the new phone at a suggested retail price of $699. Preorders open next week, and customers can put down a deposit of $100 to secure their unit. Some carriers might bundle it with data plans, effectively reducing the up-front cost to around $300, but that depends on the provider. Early adopters will likely sell out the first batch, given the hype around the updated camera and improved battery life.</p>"
        - "We rely heavily on donors, who contribute anywhere between $20 and $5,000 on an annual basis. These funds keep our shelter operational. If we manage to raise an additional $3,000 this quarter, we'll be able to expand into a new wing for kittens and puppies. Every bit helps. Our volunteers often sacrifice their weekends to host fundraising events like bake sales or car washes, usually netting about $200 or so each time."
        - "I've been hunting for used camera lenses and found one for $210, which is a steal compared to new ones that run around $600 or more. The description said it's in 'like-new' condition with minimal dust, though that's never guaranteed. Still, even if I have to pay another $50 for cleaning, I'd save a ton. I'll probably finalize the purchase tomorrow unless a better deal appears."
        - "Conference Fees:\n\n- Registration: $325\n- Workshop: $150\n- Reception: $50\n- Hotel and Travel: $600\n\nTotal: $1,125\n\nThese costs must be finalized by the end of the week to avoid any late penalties. Early bird pricing expires at midnight, so if we don't pay now, the registration jumps to about $375. Let me know if we need to proceed or wait for final approval."
        - "I was going over the hospital bill: $8,200 just for an overnight stay, plus $1,100 for lab tests. Insurance should cover about $7,000, but I'll still owe around $2,300 out of pocket. The price breakdown is absolutely wild, with things like $25 for a single dose of generic pain reliever. I might contest a few of the charges if I can figure out the itemized list, but that typically takes months."
        - "I saw a listing for a used motorbike at $2,500, which seemed fair, but on closer inspection, the seller mentioned it needed about $400 worth of repairs. That effectively pushes the cost up to $2,900. I'm going to see if the seller will negotiate further or at least cover half the repair expenses. If not, I might pass and look for a better-maintained model. It's a buyer's market in some regions, but not always."
        - "Some freelancers charge a flat rate, like $300 for a simple website design, whereas others charge hourly at $25-$30 an hour. It really depends on complexity and timeline. My last project cost $600, but that included custom graphics and SEO setup. If you're on a tight budget, you might want to do partial tasks yourself. Just be mindful that your own time has value, and the learning curve might be steep for unfamiliar software."
        - "In the grocery store, I noticed bananas priced at $0.79 per pound, strawberries at $3.50 per box, and milk at $2.99 a gallon. Inflation is definitely evident, because I remember when strawberries were around $2.50 this time of year. The produce manager said the weather has impacted harvests, so supply is more limited. Next season, it might swing back down, unless shipping costs rise further."
        - "PAY SLIP:\nGross Salary: $3,500\nDeductions:\n- Tax: $400\n- Insurance: $100\n\nNet Salary: $3,000\n\nAdditional Reimbursement:\n- Travel: $75\n- Meals: $50\n\nTotal Payment: $3,125\n\nDate: 02/05/2025\nSignature: ___________________"
        - "The last repair invoice for my car showed labor at $85 per hour. I ended up paying for 2.5 hours plus a diagnostic fee of $60, so the labor portion alone was $212.50. Parts were another $150, bringing the total near $362.50. If I'd known it was going to be that high, maybe I'd have shopped around for a cheaper garage. Unfortunately, I was in a hurry to get it fixed before a road trip."
        - "When I launched my Kickstarter, I set a modest goal of $5,000 to cover production costs. Within two weeks, we'd raised $7,300, which was enough to add some stretch goals. I never expected such generous backing from the community. Some people even pledged $100 or more to get the advanced tiers with special rewards. It's amazing how quickly a project can take off when there's genuine enthusiasm behind it."

        - "function greet() {\n  let userName = process.env.USERNAME;\n  if (!userName) {\n    userName = 'Guest';\n  }\n  console.log('Welcome, ' + userName + '!');\n}\n\n// The script retrieves the system's USERNAME from $USERNAME, falling back to 'Guest' if undefined. This approach helps maintain a seamless user experience, even if the environment variable is missing."
        - "I was editing my .bashrc file to include custom aliases. I typed:\n\nalias ll='ls -la'\necho \"Custom scripts directory: \" $SCRIPTS_DIR\n\nBut I forgot that $SCRIPTS_DIR wasn't actually set anywhere else, so it expanded to an empty string. I'll define it in a separate config file that references the correct path. It's always a good idea to keep environment variables consistent across sessions."
        - "In older codebases, you might see references to $foo and $bar, especially in languages like Perl or PHP. For instance, a snippet could look like:\n\nif ( $user_status eq 'active' ) {\n  print \"User is active\";\n} else {\n  print \"User is not active\";\n}\n\nThis style is less common in modern JavaScript or Python, but you'll still encounter it in legacy scripts."
        - "Here's a partial Dockerfile:\n\nFROM node:14\nENV APP_PORT=8080\nENV APP_ENV=production\n\nEXPOSE $APP_PORT\n\nRUN mkdir /usr/src/app && \\\n    echo \"Server running on port: \" $APP_PORT\n\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n\nThe critical line is 'EXPOSE $APP_PORT' because it dynamically sets the container port based on the environment variable."
        - "var config = {\n  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,\n  debug: process.env.DEBUG_MODE === 'true',\n};\n\nconsole.log('App running on port:', config.port);\n\n// Notice that $PORT might not be set, so we fall back to 3000. This ensures the app can run locally without requiring explicit environment variables. It's a common pattern in Node.js applications."
        - "While parsing the Jenkinsfile, I realized we rely on $BUILD_NUMBER to tag Docker images. The pipeline code snippet reads:\n\ndocker.build(\"myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER}\")\n\nBut if $BUILD_NUMBER isn't set, it defaults to 'SNAPSHOT'. This can cause confusion when multiple versions are built without a numeric tag. We'll likely implement a fallback based on commit hash or timestamp to ensure uniqueness."
        - "Consider a Python script that uses the os module to read environment variables:\n\nimport os\n\ndef read_database_url():\n    db_url = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL', 'sqlite:///default.db')\n    print(f\"Using DB: {db_url}\")\n\nThough it's Python code, the underlying environment still might rely on a shell variable like $DATABASE_URL. If it's not present, we default to a local SQLite file."
        - "Sometimes in a Kubernetes manifest, you might see something like:\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: sample-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: sample-container\n    image: myimage:latest\n    env:\n      - name: LOG_LEVEL\n        value: \"debug\"\n      - name: CUSTOM_PORT\n        valueFrom:\n          configMapKeyRef:\n            name: my-config\n            key: port\n```\nBut if we needed to reference the environment variable in a shell script, we might do echo $CUSTOM_PORT inside the container once it's running."
        - "I ran into a problem with a Makefile that did:\n\nbuild:\n\tgcc main.c -o main -DVERSION=\\\"$VERSION\\\"\n\necho \"Building version: \" $VERSION\n\nIf $VERSION isn't exported in the shell, the compiled binary won't include the correct version string. This often leads to confusion when debugging build artifacts. We resolved it by specifying VERSION in the environment before calling make."
        - "The command line argument was something like:\npython myscript.py --input data.csv --threads $THREAD_COUNT\n\nBut if $THREAD_COUNT isn't specified, I'd prefer a default of 4. In the script, I can handle that with a check:\n\nthreads = int(os.getenv('THREAD_COUNT', 4))\n\nIt's best to keep a fallback in code rather than trusting $THREAD_COUNT to always be present."
        - "In PowerShell, environment variables can appear with $env: syntax, such as $env:PATH or $env:USERNAME. However, if you're converting from a Bash script, you'll notice the difference: your script might have references like echo $PATH instead, which won't work in native PowerShell. You have to update them or rely on cross-platform environment variable expansions carefully."
        - "We discovered that in some continuous integration systems, if $HOME isn't set correctly, certain tools default to unusual paths like /tmp/home. That caused weird caching behavior for npm and pip. We eventually fixed it by explicitly setting HOME in the environment block, ensuring that the relevant package managers had a stable directory to operate in."
        - "While reviewing logs, I saw a suspicious line: echo \"API_KEY=\" $API_KEY. This is dangerous if the logs are publicly accessible, as it could expose sensitive credentials. We recommended removing or masking $API_KEY from the output entirely, or using a more secure approach like a secrets manager. Plainly printing secrets can lead to major security breaches."
        - "[Patch diff]\n```\n- echo \"Deploying with token:\" $DEPLOY_TOKEN\n+ echo \"Deploying...\"\n```\n\nWe removed the plain-text echo of $DEPLOY_TOKEN to keep it hidden from logs. This was a direct fix to a security concern flagged by code review. The new approach ensures no sensitive information is printed, aligning with best practices for DevOps pipelines."
        - "If you're writing a script in zsh, referencing an existing variable can be done the same way as in Bash: just call $SOME_VAR. The primary difference is that zsh may have slightly different defaults for path expansion or globbing. But the usage of environment variables remains quite similar across most POSIX shells."
        - "I discovered a tiny bug in the code:\n\nconst char* user = getenv(\"USER\");\nif (!user) {\n    user = \"unknown\";\n}\nprintf(\"User is: %s\\n\", user);\n\nBecause it prints out the result of $USER, we must ensure the environment actually defines it. If $USER is missing, it falls back to \"unknown.\" This is crucial in containerized or minimal environments where not all variables are set by default."
        - "SQL scripts sometimes use placeholders like :var rather than shell variables like $VAR. However, if you're wrapping your SQL in a shell script, you might do something like:\n\nsed -e \"s/:TABLE_NAME/ $TABLE_NAME/g\" schema.sql | psql -h host -d db\n\nBut that approach can be brittle if your variable includes special characters. Some prefer using a separate SQL parameter substitution method."
        - "When working with Terraform, you might pass variables via command-line like:\nterraform apply -var \"instance_type= $INSTANCE_TYPE\"\n\nBut often it's more reliable to define them in a .tfvars file or as environment variables with TF_VAR_instance_type= 'some_value'. Directly referencing $INSTANCE_TYPE might not always behave the same unless your shell environment is properly set up."
        - "In a continuous delivery script, we appended the commit SHA to a tag:\n\ndocker tag myapp:latest myapp: $GIT_SHA\n\ndocker push myapp: $GIT_SHA\n\nOf course, $GIT_SHA has to be defined by the CI system. If that environment variable doesn't exist, the script tries to push 'myapp:' with nothing after the colon, resulting in an invalid image reference. We corrected this with error handling."
        - "I'm reading a Q&A that said: \"If you're writing a Bash script, always double-quote references to variables. That means using \" $VAR\" instead of just $VAR, especially if you expect spaces or special characters.\" It's good advice, because unquoted expansions can break your scripts if the variable content isn't sanitized or if it contains whitespace."
        - "Within a Docker Compose file, referencing environment variables might look like:\n```\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  web:\n    image: myweb:latest\n    environment:\n      - API_URL= $API_URL\n```\nBut keep in mind that $API_URL must be exported in your shell first or placed in a .env file. If not, Docker Compose won't populate that environment variable for the container."
        - "In Jenkins, I used a pipeline script that said:\n\nsh 'echo Deploying version: $VERSION'\n\nHowever, I forgot to configure the parameter in the job, so $VERSION would appear as an empty string. As a result, the deployment logs didn't match the actual build version. We ended up creating a Jenkins parameter named VERSION, which gets passed through automatically, ensuring the correct tag is used in subsequent steps."
        - "It might seem odd to see references to $v_1 or $v_2 in some older shell scripts that emulate arrays. In shells without robust array support, people would hack around the limitation by storing each value in a separate variable. Then they'd iterate over them with indirect references or by numbering them. It's messy, but historically that was common practice."
        - "Our new policy requires that all environment variables containing sensitive data, like $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, must never be echoed to logs or committed to version control. Instead, we rely on masked outputs in CI/CD systems, or we supply them through a secure vault. The main idea is to keep secrets out of easily accessible logs, which might be monitored only loosely."
        - "A coworker was debugging a container that kept crashing on startup. We found out that the script inside was referencing $CONFIG_PATH, but the Dockerfile never set it. So each time the container launched, it tried to read from a nonexistent directory. The fix was either to specify CONFIG_PATH in the Dockerfile or to use a default path in the script. It's a common pitfall with environment-dependent setups."
    - meaning_label: "latex_math_mode"
      text_samples:
        - "The demonstration of Euler's identity often starts by noting that exponentiating imaginary numbers involves sinusoidal functions. For instance, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta) $, a fundamental formula from complex analysis. If we set $ \\theta = \\pi$, we arrive at $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$, revealing one of the most elegant equations in mathematics."
        - "In formal writing, you might see something like: \"We define the function as $ f(x) = \\int_0^1 t^x \\,dt $ for real values of x.\" That is a concise way to represent the integral. Sometimes, authors prefer display math, but the inline notation $f(x) = \\int_0^1 t^x \\,dt$ is perfectly acceptable in LaTeX. It's best to stay consistent throughout the paper."
        - "Consider the standard normal distribution, typically denoted $ N(0,1) $. The probability density function is given by $ \\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} $. One might also define $ \\Phi(x) $ as the cumulative distribution function, which doesn't have a closed-form antiderivative in elementary functions but is widely tabulated."
        - "To evaluate the limit, we start with the expression $ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n $. By taking the natural logarithm and applying L'Hôpital's rule, we find that the limit converges to $ e $. This classical result underpins many fundamental concepts in calculus, including continuous compound interest."
        - "While rewriting Maxwell's equations in their differential form, we see that $ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} $ and $ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} $. These elegantly summarize electromagnetic phenomena, assuming a vacuum or linear medium."
        - "We analyze the matrix $ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} $, and we want to compute its determinant. Recall that $ \\det(A) = ad - bc $, so in this case $ \\det(A) = (1)(4) - (2)(3) = -2 $. This negative result implies the matrix is invertible, and we can calculate $ A^{-1} $ using standard formulas."
        - "When discussing ring theory, we often define a ring $ R $ with a unity element denoted $ 1 \\in R $. If $ R $ is commutative, multiplication is commutative, i.e., $ ab = ba $ for all $ a, b \\in R $. One can then explore ideals, homomorphisms, and other advanced structures that generalize familiar integer arithmetic properties."
        - "For a polynomial $ p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0 $, one might investigate the roots by employing the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root $ \\frac{p}{q} $ (in lowest terms) must satisfy that p divides $ a_0 $ and q divides $ a_n $. This can help narrow the search for potential roots in integer-coefficient polynomials."
        - "In many treatments of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation is introduced as $ i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) $. Solutions to this equation yield probability amplitudes that are interpreted via $ |\\Psi|^2 $. The interplay between wave functions, operators, and measurement is central to the theory."
        - "When analyzing logistic growth, we might define the function $ P(t) $ as the population at time t, satisfying $ \\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right) $. Solving this differential equation yields $ P(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + Ae^{-rt}} $, where A is determined by initial conditions. This model is often used in ecology to describe limited resource growth."
        - "It's common in geometry to reference the angles of a triangle, for instance $ \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = \\pi $ radians. Alternatively, one might note in degrees that $ \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ $. Moving to spherical geometry changes that sum, revealing a fundamental distinction between flat and curved spaces."
        - "Be mindful that in LaTeX, using inline math like $x = 5$ is different from display math like $$ x = 5 $$. The double dollar signs produce a centered equation environment, which is typically used for prominent formulas. If the formula is short and fits within the text flow, the inline notation $ x = 5 $ is more appropriate."
        - "Within group theory, an example is the group $S_n$, the symmetric group on n elements. An element of $ S_3 $, for instance, can be written in cycle notation such as $ (1\\,2\\,3) $. The multiplication of two permutations corresponds to the composition of their cycles, which can be easily visualized with diagrams."
        - "A key identity in trigonometry is $ \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1 $. From here, we derive numerous related formulas like $ \\tan^2\\theta + 1 = \\sec^2\\theta $. These relationships are fundamental when exploring circles, angles, and the unit circle definition of sine and cosine. Combined, they unify many geometric theorems."
        - "Suppose we define a function $ g(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 $. Factoring reveals $ g(x) = (x+1)(x+2) $. The roots are $ -1 $ and $ -2 $, so the graph crosses the x-axis at those points. In calculus, we'd find $ g'(x) = 2x + 3 $, indicating a critical point where $ 2x + 3 = 0 $. That's at $ x = -\\frac{3}{2} $."
        - "Sometimes you might write an inline fraction like $ \\frac{1}{2} $ directly in text if it's short. But for more complex expressions, you might prefer $ \\displaystyle \\frac{x^2+2x+1}{x^2-2x+1} $ in display mode. The choice depends on readability and how large or complicated the expression is. Always keep your audience in mind."
        - "The binomial theorem is written as $ (x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k} $. This expands the power of a sum into a sum of products. Its importance extends to probabilities, where we use it to model independent events via the binomial distribution $ \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p) $. Combinatorial identities often spring from careful manipulations of this theorem."
        - "For sequences, it's often helpful to define the nth term as $ a_n = 2^n + 3 $. Then we check if $ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n $ converges. Obviously, $ 2^n $ grows without bound, so the limit diverges to infinity. If the sequence were $ a_n = \\frac{1}{n} $, then we'd see $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0$. The behavior of sequences can often be captured elegantly with LaTeX notation."
        - "Consider an integral of the form $ \\int_0^1 x^p (1-x)^q \\, dx $. This is closely related to the Beta function, $ B(p+1, q+1) $. In fact, $ B(p+1, q+1) = \\frac{\\Gamma(p+1)\\Gamma(q+1)}{\\Gamma(p+q+2)} $. Using the identities for Gamma functions reveals deeper connections to factorials in discrete cases, where p and q are nonnegative integers."
        - "Hyperbolic functions can be defined as $ \\sinh x = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} $ and $ \\cosh x = \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} $. Interestingly, $ \\cosh^2 x - \\sinh^2 x = 1 $. They mirror many trigonometric identities but behave differently with respect to real arguments, reflecting hyperbolic geometry's unique properties."
        - "A typical partial differential equation might look like $ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $. This is Laplace's equation, describing equilibrium phenomena. Solutions to Laplace's equation are harmonic functions, satisfying the mean value property. In two dimensions, such solutions are closely tied to analytic functions in complex analysis."
        - "The Riemann zeta function is defined by $ \\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s} $ for $ \\mathrm{Re}(s) > 1 $. Its analytic continuation to the entire complex plane (except a pole at s=1) leads to deep results in number theory, most famously the Riemann Hypothesis, which states that the nontrivial zeros all have real part $ \\frac{1}{2} $."
        - "Sometimes you'll see something like $ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\; x^2 \\ge 0 $ in real analysis, indicating that any real number squared is nonnegative. This is a core property that helps build up the ordering structure of the real numbers. By contrast, in complex numbers, there's no analogous order that respects multiplication in the same way."
        - "When discussing spherical coordinates, we have $ x = r\\sin\\phi \\cos\\theta $, $ y = r\\sin\\phi \\sin\\theta $, and $ z = r\\cos\\phi $. The volume element is $ dV = r^2 \\sin\\phi \\, dr \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta $. Using $ 0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi $, $ 0 \\le \\phi \\le \\pi $, and $ 0 \\le r \\le a $, we can compute the volume of a sphere of radius a: $ \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3 $."
        - "To show that a series converges absolutely, we check if $ \\sum |a_n| $ converges. For instance, the geometric series $ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty ar^n $ converges if $ |r| < 1 $. Similarly, tests like the ratio test or the root test can help determine convergence. If $ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| < 1 $, it typically means absolute convergence."

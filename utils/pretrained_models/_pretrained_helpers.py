    """
    Sort the `topk` axis descending by `weights`, and apply the same permutation to expert IDs (and optional raw expert outputs). 
    - For Deepseek-based architectures, all functions that return top-k or activations must sort these, since the MoE 
      MUST be run with sorted = False.
    - For most models, MoEs can be run with sorted = True. However, it may be useful to call this on code that involves 
      ablation to re-sort the IDs, weights, and expert outputs according to the new topk order.
 
    Params:
        @ids: BN x k tensor of expert IDs
        @weights: BN x k tensor of gate probs
        @outputs BN x k x D tensor of raw expert outputs (optional)

    Returns:
        ids_sorted, weights_sorted, outputs_sorted (None if outputs is None)
